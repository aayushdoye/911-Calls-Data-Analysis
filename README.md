Analysis of 911 call data with EDA, time-series insights, and visualizations built using Python(Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

911 Calls Data Analysis

A guided, hands-on data analysis project

Overview

This project explores emergency call data to identify trends in call volume, major emergency categories, and time-based patterns. It was completed as part of a guided learning module, where I implemented all the analysis steps independently using Python and common data science libraries.

Objectives

Clean and preprocess the 911 call dataset
Extract useful features from timestamps
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Visualize trends across time and emergency types
Highlight insights relevant for emergency response planning

Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights

Identified peak hours and days for emergency calls
Analyzed major call categories (EMS, Fire, Traffic)
Discovered time-series patterns such as seasonal or hourly trends
Created visualizations showing emergency hotspots and volume spikes

Project Type

This is a guided project, completed through a structured module to practice real-world data analysis workflows. While the project follows a predefined dataset and objectives, all coding, analysis, and visualization work was done by me.
